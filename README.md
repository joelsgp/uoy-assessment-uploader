# uoy_assessment_uploader

## Install
When you have python and pip ready, it's as easy as:
```shell
python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/joelsgp/uoy-assessment-uploader"
```

### chromedriver
This is the hard part, you also need the webdriver that lets Python operate a browser instance.

1. First you need Google Chrome (Chromium won't work, Ungoogled Chrome will), that's the easy part of the hard part. 
2. Then you can download directly here: <https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads>
   1. if you download manually, make sure to add it to PATH.

Or, with one of these package managers:
- Arch
    ```shell
    paru -S chromedriver
    ```
- Fedora
    ```shell
    
    ```
