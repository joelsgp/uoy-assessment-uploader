# uoy_assessment_uploader

## Install
1. When you have python and pip ready, it's as easy as:
    ```shell
    python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/joelsgp/uoy-assessment-uploader"
    ```
2. You need the Chrome browser installed. Sorry!
    - It needs a cookie management feature Firefox doesn't have.
    - If you have Chromium instead, pass the `--chromium` flag.
